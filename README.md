Howdy!

This project is my first in gamemaker. I've made silly little things in everything from Scratch, to Unreal and back to Unity;
but really wanted to get into the bones of gamemaker. It's a fantastic piece of software for 2D development, and while
I don't use visual scripting, I wanted a system that had a visual scripting component so I would be able to collaborate 
with my friends that don't code. And thus, this!

This project is being made ostiensibly for the FFS 2024 game jam, found here: https://itch.io/jam/finally-finish-something-2024
I stumbled accross this jam while making this in prepation for a tighter jam with a friend of mine in Febuary, and it gives a greater context
to what I hope to achieve with this project. 

My intention is to have a fully playable, minimalist and vaguelly polished prototype by the end of the month. Strong emphasis on having a enjoyable core loop, 
and learning that basics of game maker to prepare for future game jams. At time of writing, the project as ostensiably, accomplished this. I was able to complete
the loop that I expected to take a month in roughly two days. But! That just leaves lots of room for experimentation. 

Regardless, I hope you enjoy my little game, and that this reposity can serve as a learning point for any other new devs. My code is messy, with
inconsistent naming schemes and uses deprecated functions that pose a future bug filled nightmare. But it is a fully playable little game, and one
I am happy with.
